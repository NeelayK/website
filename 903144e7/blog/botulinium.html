                        Botulinium toxin is a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related
                        species.
                        It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular
                        junction
                        and thus causes flaccid paralysis. Infection with the bacterium causes the disease botulism. The
                        toxin is also
                        used commercially for medical and cosmetic purposes.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        There are seven main types of botulinum toxin, named type A–G. New types are occasionally found.[1]
                        Types A and B are capable of causing disease in humans, and are also used commercially and medically.
                        Types C–G are less common; types E and F can cause disease in humans, while the other types cause
                        disease in
                        other animals.[2] Botulinum toxin types A and B are used in medicine to treat various muscle spasms
                        and
                        diseases characterized by overactive muscle. The commercial form is marketed under the brand name
                        Botox, among
                        others. It is also sold commercially as Myobloc and Neurobloc in the European Union.[3] In the United
                        States,
                        Botox and Botox Cosmetic are botulinum toxins produced by the company Allergan. Dysport is a
                        botulinum toxin
                        produced by Ipsen. Xeomin is the botulinum toxin produced by Merz Pharmaceuticals.[4] BTX-A is also
                        used in the treatment of gummy smiles,[5][6] migraine,[7] and other medical conditions. Actors and actresses who need to sustain a movie career as superheroes well into their 60s
                        can’t do it without a little chemical help! (Strictly legal chemicals only) In most cases, the
                        molecule behind their creaseless faces is this marvellous little protein called Botulin.
                        Botulin, or Botulinum toxin, is a protein derived from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and is
                        heavily used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries! However don’t let those shining
                        faces fool you; Botulin packs a lot of punches!
                        <br><br>

                        Botulinum toxin is used to treat a number of problems. It may help treat excessive sweating, certain
                        eye
                        disorders, muscle spasms, and even migraines. It may also help improve the appearance of wrinkles.
                        Botulinum
                        toxin works by weakening or paralyzing certain muscles or by blocking certain nerves. The effects
                        last about
                        three to twelve months, depending on what you are treating. The most common side effects are pain,
                        swelling,
                        or bruising at the injection site. You could also have flu-like symptoms, headache, and upset
                        stomach. Injections
                        in the face may also cause temporary drooping eyelids. You should not use botulinum toxin if you are
                        pregnant
                        or breastfeeding.

                        Botulin is incredibly neurotoxic, and is among the most potent toxins known to humankind.
                        Botulin acts at neuromuscular junctions by preventing axon terminals from releasing
                        acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter. The toxin cleaves SNARE proteins, thus
                        preventing acetylcholine release. This causes flaccid paralysis, and in extreme cases even
                        botulism.
                        Botulin can act at any neuromuscular junction, which means that it can potentially shut down the
                        action of any muscle in its vicinity, even the heart. This makes it a very dangerous and
                        interesting molecule. <br>

                        </div>

                        However, this very property of Botulin makes it pharmaceutically relevant. Scientists have
                        leveraged this neurotoxicity for applications in treating spasticity (overactive muscle movement),
                        strabismus (improper eye alignment due to muscle action) and most famously in cosmetics, for
                        removing wrinkles by relaxing facial membranes. At the same time, it has also been used for
                        more nefarious purposes. Botulin was famously weaponized in WW2 and remains an active
                        agent in bioterrorism. <br> <br>

                        Botulin is a protein, and is thus made up of amino acids. It is a 150 kDa protein, and is
                        composed of a heavy chain and a light chain. The heavy chain is responsible for binding to
                        receptors on the cell membrane, while the light chain is responsible for the neurotoxicity. The
                        light chain is a zinc endopeptidase, and cleaves SNARE proteins, which are responsible for
                        vesicle fusion and thus neurotransmitter release. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Botulin is a very interesting molecule, and has been used for a variety of purposes. It is
                        pharmaceutically relevant, and has been used to treat a variety of conditions. It is also
                        incredibly dangerous, and has been used as a weapon of war. It is also used in cosmetics, and
                        has been used by actors and actresses to maintain their youthful appearance. <br> <br>
                        So what is our takeaway? Botulin is a molecule with fascinating properties that can be used to
                        hurt or heal, and it is the human who ascribes a purpose, moral or immoral, to it. Every molecule
                        is cool, and it is up to humans to use them wisely.
